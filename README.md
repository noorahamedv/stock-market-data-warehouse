# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Data Warehouse

This project implements a dimensional data warehouse model for analyzing historical stock market performance. It uses SQL-based OLAP queries, data cubes, and visualizations to deliver business intelligence insights to analysts and investors.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Summary

This data warehousing solution is designed to:
- Consolidate and structure daily stock performance data.
- Enable OLAP operations such as drill-down, roll-up, slice & dice.
- Support visualizations for stock metrics, volumes, and trends.
- Deliver actionable insights for forecasting and financial decision-making.

## ðŸ§± Data Model

**Fact Table**  
- `fact_stock_data`: Includes stock prices (open, close, high, low), adjusted close, volume, etc.

**Dimension Tables**  
- `dim_time`: Time attributes (date, month, year)  
- `dim_stock`: Stock tickers and company mapping  
- `dim_company`: Company names and ticker info  
- `dim_index`: Market index info and volumes
