# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Data Warehouse

This project implements a dimensional data warehouse model for analyzing historical stock market performance. It uses SQL-based OLAP queries, data cubes, and visualizations to deliver business intelligence insights to analysts and investors.

## ðŸš€ Project Summary

This data warehousing solution is designed to:
- Consolidate and structure daily stock performance data.
- Enable OLAP operations such as drill-down, roll-up, slice & dice.
- Support visualizations for stock metrics, volumes, and trends.
- Deliver actionable insights for forecasting and financial decision-making.
